## Findings 
  Charter schools have average math scores (83.47) and reading scores (83.90) that are significantly higher than the District schools'. They also have much higher percentages of students passing math (93.62%) and reading (96.59%), as well as a higher overall passing rate of 90.43%.

  Schools that spend less than $585 per student on average have higher average scores in math (83.46) and reading (83.93). These schools also have higher percentages of students passing math (93.46%), reading (96.61%), and an overall passing rate of 90.37%. Academic performance and passing rates seem to decline with increased spending, as higher-spending schools have lower test scores and lower percentages of passing students.

  With the data we are able to come to the conclusion that Charter schools outperform District schools as well as the fact that schools with a higher per student spending range does not necessarily mean they will outperform students from schools with a lower per student spending range.
